## Strengthen Your Defenses: The Role of Internal and External Pentests 
Effective cybersecurity requires addressing threats from both inside and outside your organization. Automated solutions streamline this process, enabling IT teams to implement a holistic and proactive defense strategy.

Internal Pentesting: Securing the Core#
Internal pentesting simulates an attacker operating within your network, exposing vulnerabilities such as insider threats, compromised credentials, or breaches through physical or remote access. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited after bypassing external defenses.

## Key Benefits of Internal Pentesting:
1. Detect and Mitigate Insider Threats: Proactively identify and address risks from malicious actors or compromised accounts.
2. Validate Critical Systems: Assess the security of core assets and critical systems, such as file servers, Active Directory, and Microsoft Exchange.
3. Strengthen Internal Systems: Detect weaknesses in user permissions, and improve network segmentation, and system configurations to limit lateral movement from attackers within the network.
4. Test Incident Response Plans: Validate the organization's ability to detect, respond to, and recover from breaches originating inside the network.
5. Meet compliance requirements: Annual internal network pentesting is required for standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and SOC2 etc.

### External Pentesting: Protecting the Perimeter
External pentesting focuses on securing internet-facing systems, such as websites, APIs, and email servers. These tests mimic the tactics of attackers attempting to infiltrate your network from the outside.

## Key Benefits of External Pentesting:
1. Harden Perimeter Defenses: Secure firewalls, routers, and public-facing systems to prevent unauthorized access.
2. Identifying Exploitable Vulnerabilities: Address issues such as unpatched software or misconfigurations.
3. Defend Against Opportunistic Attacks: Regular testing helps organizations stay ahead of automated scans and targeted attacks.
4. Meet compliance requirements: Bi-annual external network pentesting is required for standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO 27001.
Together, internal and external pentesting provides a 360-degree view of your organization's security posture, enabling you to mitigate risks before they become breaches effectively.

## Why Automation is the Future of Network Pentesting
While traditional manual network pentesting has its benefits, it only gives you a snapshot of your risk at that point in time while attackers and modern cyber threats evolve daily. Automated network pentesting addresses these challenges and offers a smarter, faster way to stay ahead:

1. Cost Efficiency: Traditional manual pentesting often comes with a hefty price tag, but automated solutions drastically lower the cost. This makes regular, high-quality security assessments both practical and accessible for organizations of all sizes, regardless of budget constraints.
2. Increased Frequency: Instead of annual checks, automation allows monthly or on-demand testing, ensuring you're always prepared.
3. Comprehensive Coverage: Automated solutions provide thorough and consistent results, uncovering vulnerabilities that may be missed due to limited scope, time constraints, or human error during manual assessments.
4. Actionable Insights: Real-time results and detailed reports from automated solutions prioritize vulnerabilities and recommend remediation strategies, helping IT teams address risks efficiently.
5. Simplify Compliance: Automated tools generate reports or have 3rd party integrations built in that make meeting regulatory requirements easier and more efficient.
